## A Case for Simplicity

I want to see how much functionality I can achieve without JavaScript, or at
least without frameworks, build tools, etc., the goal being to prove what's
possible without the bloat and baggage of the modern web dev toolchain. I
wonder how many people think React & Friends are the default, or worse only,
option for building useful web tools, which I don't think is the case.

I could be completely wrong and well on my way to making a fool of myself,
but I want to know first-hand what's possible with plain old HTML & CSS, and
maybe a tiny bit of pure JS to achieve otherwise impossible functionality. I'm
not talking fun animation and interactivity, just the bare essentials.

It also might be interesting to do a comparison between the implementation of
a web tool vs. the implementation of a native one to demonstrate the distance
between the two of those.

**Potential projects in this domain:**

- Note-taking/organization tool
- File storage/sharing
- News aggregator
